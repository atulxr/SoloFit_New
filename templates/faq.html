          <h3>Question1:</h3>
          <h2>How often should I work out?</h2>
          <p>Answer: </p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">It's generally recommended to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week. However, the frequency of workouts can vary based on individual goals, fitness level, and schedule. Consistency is key, so find a routine that works for you and stick to it.</p>

          <h3>Question2:</h3>
          <h2>What should I eat before and after a workout?</h2>
          <p>Answer: </p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">Before a workout, it's ideal to consume a balanced meal or snack that includes carbohydrates for energy and protein for muscle repair and growth. Some good pre-workout options include a banana with almond butter, Greek yogurt with fruit, or a turkey and cheese sandwich on whole-grain bread. After a workout, aim to refuel your body with a combination of protein and carbohydrates to aid in recovery. Examples include a protein shake with fruit, grilled chicken with quinoa, or a veggie omelet with whole-grain toast.</p>

          <h3>Question3:</h3>
          <h2>How do I prevent injuries during exercise?</h2>
          <p>Answer: </p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">To prevent injuries, it's important to warm up properly before starting your workout, maintain proper form during exercises, gradually increase intensity and duration, and listen to your body. Incorporating stretching, strength training, and rest days into your routine can also help reduce the risk of injury. Additionally, wearing appropriate footwear and using proper equipment are essential for injury prevention.</p>

          <h2>How do I stay motivated to exercise regularly?</h2>
          <p>Answer:</p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            Staying motivated to exercise regularly can be challenging, but setting specific, achievable goals, finding activities you enjoy, and varying your routine can help keep you engaged.

          <h2>What's the best way to track my progress?</h2>
          <p>Answer:</p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            Tracking your progress can help you stay motivated and make adjustments to your workout routine as needed. You can track progress using various methods, including keeping a workout journal, using fitness apps or wearable devices, taking regular measurements of your body, and monitoring changes in strength, endurance, and flexibility. Choose a tracking method that works best for you and allows you to see your improvements over time.

          <h3>Question6:</h3>
          <h2>What's the importance of stretching before and after workouts?</h2>
          <p>Answer:</p>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            Stretching before a workout helps increase flexibility, improve range of motion, and reduce the risk of injury by preparing your muscles for activity. Dynamic stretching, which involves moving your muscles through a full range of motion, is ideal for warming up before exercise. After a workout, static stretching can help improve flexibility and prevent muscle tightness. Incorporating both types of stretching into your routine can aid in recovery and overall muscle health.
